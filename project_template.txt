1) Introduction
- We describe the numerical integration problem. We explain some techinques and then we explain the Romber Method.
- Serial code of the method in general.
- We explain the paper we found.

2) Parallel design.
- We explain the serial code of the paper.
- We prove the similarity with the Romberg's method in general.
- We analyze data dependencies (DETAILED).
- We show unparallelizable parts. We address it with parallel scan.

3) Implementation.
- Implement parallel code in the paper. No OpenMP is used, tell it.
- Implement parallel code with OUR strategy (MPI and OpenMP). Can be just parallel code of the paper + OpenMP or another strategy.
- Explain pros and cons of each strategy.

4) Benchmarking.
- Explain how we increase the size of the problem: function more complex.
- We do benchmarking of both implementation (multiple runs, means, std devand confidence intervals of execution times, speedup and efficiency):
- - same size, incraese processors (strong scalability)
- - size increasing according in how processors are increasing (weak scalability)
- Plots.
